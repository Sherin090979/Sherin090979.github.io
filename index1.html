            <h3>AWS Infrastructure Deployment</h3>
            <p>In this project, I utilized AWS to set up storage solutions and initiate multiple EC2 instances. I implemented an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly across instances, enhancing the application's performance and reliability. Additionally, I leveraged AWS IAM for secure access management and utilized S3 for efficient data storage and retrieval.

                Outcomes: The project resulted in a robust cloud infrastructure that optimized resource utilization, improved application availability, and ensured secure data storage practices. This experience deepened my understanding of AWS services and their role in developing scalable solutions.</p>
